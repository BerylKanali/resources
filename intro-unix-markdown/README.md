### Title
Intro Tutorial: Unix & Markdown

### Description
Learn to work more efficiently. If you're new to Unix and Markdown, this intro tutorial has tips on how to set up your workspace.  It provides time-saving tips on all the peripheral tasks so you can spend more time on Python.

### Level
Beginners

### Abstract
In this talk, I will share 5 examples of 5 different topics that were at one time foreign to me. The goal of presenting 5 is enough to get you started, and you can explore more on your own. I will do a quick example of how to create a markdown file on GitHub and view it live. I will show how to set up your bash profile with 5 shortcuts so you can avoid unnecessary typing when navigating through your directories. I'll share my 5 most commonly used GREP commands, 5 keystroke shortcuts that work in almost any editor and 5 of my favorite bash programs.
