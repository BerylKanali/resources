The video has been posted for **[Software Testing in Open Source and Data Science](https://youtu.be/bJGgVoV4GTc)**.

A link to the **slides** is included in the video description.

This presentation covers:
- Importance of software testing in OSS (open source science) software: correctness, reliability, contracts against breakages in the future.
- Why software testing actually matters for data scientists' work as well, with a case study from my daily work.
- Where to get practice with software testing
- Navigating the tradeoff between immediate velocity and long-term productivity when deciding how much to test.

Goals of the presentation:  
- To share hard-won lessons borne out of failures of the speaker's past, Eric Ma, who is a data scientist at Moderna.
- To encourage you to embrace testing as part of your workflow.
