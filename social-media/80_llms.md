- NLP = Natural Language Processing
- LLMs = Large Language Models

LLMs have changed what it means to "do natural language processing", opening up the fields to newcomers and beginners. This talk presents some traditional NLP tasks and how they can be fielded using prompting and tools such as GPT-4. Discussion of open source tools (like OpenChatKit) is also included.
