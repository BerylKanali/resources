A tutorial video for Bayesian fans: **[Bayesian Data Analysis with BRMS (Bayesian Regression Models Using Stan)](https://youtu.be/A1NWoKQhgJE)**

Speaker: Mitzi Morris (member of the Stan Development Team)

A link to the **slides** is included in the video description. There are timestamps on the video to easily get to specific sections. 

Mitzi shows how you can quickly build robust models for data analysis and prediction using BRMS. After a brief overview of the the advantages and limitations of BRMS and a quick review of multi-level regression, we will work through an R-markdown notebook together, to see how to fit, visualize, and test the goodness of the model and resulting estimates.
